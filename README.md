# Amber Benbow's Patient-Intake Assessment

I decided to create an intake simulating a Emergency visit.

I established respective procedure codes for make and female intake with a set time of 15 minutes.

I created a function that randomly selects three treatments with various treatment times that the patient will receive during their visit.

I also included an observation treatment that creates a time lapse of 24 hours to simulate an in-patient stay.

I formated the print statements to be visually appealing and easy to read for the end user.

I also included a formatted text statement to print at the conclusion that summarizes the patient name, length of stay and number of treatments.
